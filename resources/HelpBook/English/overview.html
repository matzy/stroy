<h1>Overview</h1>

    <h2>What is Stroy?</h2>
        Stroy is a graphical directory diff tool.<br>

        Tools of this kind show a structural diff, i.e. show you what files changed
        were added or deleted. Stroy does this but additionaly it shows structural changes,
        i.e. moves and renames.<br>

        Stroy even matches files when they are renamed, moved and content changed.


    <h2>Licence</h2>
    Stroy's licence is <a href="licence.html">MPL1.1</a>
    <p> </p>

    <h2>The stroy idea. Where does the name come from?</h2>

        When humans read stroy a with some mispselled words or wrongly placed words they
        can grasp the maening of the text still.<br>

        If a program could just do that it would have no problem tracking files to new locations
        even if they are somewhat changed. It could do that without further information, no
        human intervention or tracking information, i.e. .svn dirs.<br>
    <p> </p>

    <h2>What can stroy be used for?</h2>

        <ul>
        <li>Simple SCM</li>
            Just save your whole source tree to a backup location. Stroy can tell you what the changes
            between 2 versions are.

        <li>Syncing directories/work of 2 computers</li>
            Stroy can handle changes done to both sides. It can not merge yet.

        <li>After the fact diff</li>
            Stroy does not need any helper files or checkout to tell you what happened.
        </ul>
