    <h1>Preferences</h1>

    <p> </p>


    <h2>Filetype Actions</h2>
    Per filetype stroy lets you choose open, diff programs and the algorithm used to compare files.
    <p> </p>

    <h2>Default Values for Directories</h2>
    stroy remembers your last choice.
    <p> </p>

    <h2>Filter</h2>
    Filters keeps scm files/dir (.svn) and other noise files out of the diff. There is a preconfigured selection
    for the common cases. Add more as appropriate. A right click on a file delivers a specialized dialog
    to filter out that file or all files of that type.
    <p> </p>


    <h2>Logs</h2>
    stroy is not very talkative, it trys to do all operations as seamless as possible. But if
    you want to see what it does change the loglevel settings.
