From Hello World to the World

- I got a stuck with too many idea and the big refactoring
- how to get back (part 7.27)?

- Rewrite the damn thing form the ground up
- philosophy start with hello world
   keep it working
   add to it and refactor until it is what you want
   document the process

    - test svn package move
      intellij 8. Checkout the project from within intellij. choose svn 1.5 metainfo.
      - moving directories worked, yah
      - moving packages gets confused by same package name in other modules
      => move in 'project' mode

    - created new module 'stroy2' lets start anew
    - save 1

    - command arg handling

    - oops renaming a package affects all other packages with the same name in other modules
      remove the other modules from the project first
      do not move them outside intellij
