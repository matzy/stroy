idea: match the trees such that the edit distance is minimal
      but don't match completly different nodes


problems:
g' content changed same name
g- content similar, different name

--
T1:
 r/a/f g h

T2:
 r/x/f g h
   y/f g h
   z/f g h

that should be one move a-> y  or ...

--
T1:
r/a/f g

t2:
r/x/f g'

one move and one update a->x g->g'

--
T1:
r/a/f g

r/a/f g'
  b/x g

standard strat will make that
new b x and g

--
T1:
r/a/f g x y z

T2:
r/b/f g' x y z
  c/g

std: a->b a/g -> c/g new g': feels wrong

-> name more important than content?

=> distance for dirs soly based on their content by name?

q:

is distance a mathematical distance?


goal: history of leaves is important, history of dirs not (.app !!)
      no suprises
