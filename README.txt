stroy trunk

This is the toplevel directory for development of stroy and other tools.
For stable versions see under branches.

The project consists of several modules. Most are for library development.
    legacy    is stroy a smart dir diff
    goethepad is fausterize a simple crypto tool

IDE is intellij IDEA (community edition) but I tried eclipse and netbeans too.

The idea is that checkin out and starting idea or running ant should be enough but it is not there yet.
Note: The stable branch with only stroy has a working build.xml
