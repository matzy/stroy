find:
    refactor Args
    wish: a list of args should be transformed into a class with
          the parsed arguments or some helper methods

    was: fat method via constructor with test method
    new: builder/factory with build and test methods

utils:
     delete Maybe
     this is just null or is it
     yes iff you use the following convention:
        getX throws and error if X can't be delivered,
            i.e. it always returns non null
        findX can return null

find:
    test with some files, checkedin
    standard problem with idea: how to represent java files as resources and
    not as source and have them work, copy to target ...

    pwd is top of project, at least on this machine (TODO test)

    this works. Because no class paths are used it is also refactor safe if a bit
    clumsy

find/base:
    find can read dirs / now it needs content compare
