org.openCage.fausterize.intro = Wellcome to fausterize.\n\
  fausterize is a little crypto program.\n\
  It encrypts texts with a simple but save one-time-pad algorithm\n\
  \n\
  Choose a a file as a key for encoding/decoding.\n\
  Any file will as long as it is big enough (e.g. >5k) and never changed.\n\
  You can use a picture, an executable a mp3 song or even a long text.\n\
  As long as you don't reuse the file the encryption is very secure.\n\
  A extra feature is the further encoding as lines of the novel Faust from Goethe (in German), hence the name.\n\
  A benefit is that the result is 7bit save a can be send as email text without triggering spam or virus filters.\n\
  Have fun.\n\
