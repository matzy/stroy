org.openCage.fausterize.intro = Welcome to fausterize.\
\
fausterize is a little crypto program which encrypts text files with a\
simple but safe one-time-pad algorithm.\
\
Choose a file as a key for encoding/decoding.  Any file will do as\
long as it is large enough (e.g. >5k) and is never modified (location\
is irrelevant).  You can use a picture, an executable, an mp3 song or\
even a long text file. As long as you don't reuse the file, the\
encryption is secure.\
\
An added benefit is that the file is further encoded as lines from\
the novel Faust by Goethe (in German), hence the name.  This results\
in a text that is 7bit safe and can be sent as email without triggering\
spam or virus filters.\
\
Have fun.\
