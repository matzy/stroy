org.openCage.fausterize.decode = decode
org.openCage.fausterize.intro = Choose a a file as a key for encoding/decoding.\n\
  Any file will do if it is long enough (e.g. >5k) and never changed.\n\
  You can use a picture, an executable a mp3 song or even a long text.\n\
  As long as you don't reuse the file the encryption is very secure.\n\
  The algorithm is simple, i.e. one time pad encryption.\n\
  A added gag is the further encoding as lines of the Faust text from Goethe, hence the name.\n\
  A benefit is that the result is 7bit save a can be send as email text without triggering spam or virus filters.\n\
  Have fun.\n\
