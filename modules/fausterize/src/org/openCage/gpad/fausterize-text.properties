org.openCage.fausterize.intro = Wellcome to fausterize.\n\
  fausterize is a little crypto program.\n\
  It encrypts texts with a simple but save one-time-pad algorithm\n\
  \n\
  Choose a a file as a key for encoding/decoding.\n\
  Any file will do as long as it is big enough (e.g. >5k) and is never modified (location is irrelevant).\n\
  You can use a picture, an executable, a mp3 song or even a long text.\n\
  As long as you don't reuse the file the encryption is very secure.\n\
  An extra feature is the further encoding as lines of the novel Faust from Goethe (in German), hence the name.\n\
  A benefit is that the result is 7bit save and can be send as email text without triggering spam or virus filters.\n\
  Have fun.\n\
