org.openCage.fausterize.intro = Welcome to fausterize.\n\
\n\
fausterize is a little crypto program which encrypts text files with a\n\
simple but safe one-time-pad algorithm.\n\
\n\
Choose a file as a key for encoding/decoding.  Any file will do as\n\
long as it is large enough (e.g. >5k) and is never modified (location\n\
is irrelevant).  You can use a picture, an executable, an mp3 song or\n\
even a long text file. As long as you don't reuse the file, the\n\
encryption is secure.\n\
\n\
An added benefit is that the file is further encoded as lines from\n\
the novel Faust by Goethe (in German), hence the name.  This results\n\
in a text that is 7bit safe and can be sent as email without triggering\n\
spam or virus filters.\
\n\
Have fun.\n\
