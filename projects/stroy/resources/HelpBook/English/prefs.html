    <h1>Preferences</h1>

    <h2>External Programs</h2>
    stroy uses external programs to open and diff files or show as text. These programs can be changed.
    <p> </p>


    <h2>Filetype Actions</h2>
    Per filetype stroy lets you choose open and diff programs and the algorithm used to compare files.
    <p> </p>

    <h2>Default Values for Directories</h2>
    stroy remembers your last choice.
    <p> </p>

    <h2>Filter</h2>
    Filters keep scm files/dir (.svn) and other noise files out of the diff. There is a preconfigured selection
    for the common cases. Add more as appropriate. A right click on a file delivers a specialized dialog
    to filter out that file or all files of that type.
    <p> </p>


    <h2>Logs</h2>
    stroy is not very talkative. It trys to do all operations as seamless as possible. But if
    you want to see what it does change the loglevel settings.
    <p> </p>

    <h2>Language</h2>
    Choose the language of stroy. The default is just your OS setting, or pick English, German, Japanese or Spanish.
    Note: Spanish localization is not complete and falls back to English.
    <p> </p>

    <h2>Update</h2>
    stroy can check for updates. The interval is configurable.
